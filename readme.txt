Optimize your website for maximum convertibility. This plugin lets you use SplitWit to run experiments on your WordPress website.

== Description ==

This plugin automatically adds the SplitWit code snippet to your WordPress site. SplitWit lets you create a variation of your web page using our visual editor. It splits traffic between the original version and your variation. You can track key metrics, and let SplitWit determine a winner. No code needed.

After creating a SplitWit account, and starting a project, you can add the project ID code to the plugin's settings page. That's all you need to start improving your site's conversion rate.

This plugin relies on SplitWit, a third-party service. The SplitWit service adds code to your website to run A/B experiments. It also collects data about how users interact with your site, based on the metrics you configure.
